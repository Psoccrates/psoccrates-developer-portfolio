## Lessons Learned

I was able to practice a multitude of important design and development concepts while building this portfolio.

**Design concepts: contrast, repetition, choosing colors based on the meaning of the project I want to convey to reader; and choosing font pairs that are in harmony.**

**Development Concepts: utilizing reusable components or bottom up development, supplying modern image formats such as webp, and practicing object-oriented CSS; separating structure from content and container from “skin.”**
